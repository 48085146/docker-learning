## From Monolith to Microservices

Break your application/system in small units
Use the strangler pattern

## Microsservices - Benefits

Improved faut isolation
Eliminate vendor or technology lock-in
Ease of Understanding
Smaller and faster deployments
Scalability

## Microsservices - Drawbacks

Complexity is added to resolve complexity issues
Testing may appear simpler but is it ?
Deployment may appear simpler but ist it ?
Multiple databases
Latency issues.
Transient errors
Multiple point of failures
How about security?
